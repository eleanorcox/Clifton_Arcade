# Clifton Arcade 3D Model
## Character and Set Design Coursework, University of Bristol, 11/2017

This repo contains my Character and Set Design CW1, a 3D model of Clifton Arcade in Bristol, UK. The Maya file of the completed scene was too large to host on github so has not been added to the repo, however I have uploaded it to Google Drive (link to follow). Alternatively if you would like a copy please email me at `eleanor.cox.dev@gmail.com` For those without Maya, I have included a number of photos highlighting some details of the modelling process in `/Process Photos`. I have also included some final renders of the completed scene, available in `/Renders` and below.

## Virtual Tour
The following renders of Clifton Arcade give a rough tour around the Arcade. Note the white sections in the dragon ironwork - these are due to incorrectly modelling certain parts of the ironwork, causing a render error. An improved model would fix the geometry here.
